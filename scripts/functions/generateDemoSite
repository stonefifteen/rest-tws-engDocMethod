# Generates a "simple" web site via Antora. A simple site is one that does not
#	attempt to track non-main branches in the underlying repositories, thereby
#	allowing Antora to handle all Git interactions.
#
#	Each repository contributing content to the site *must* meet these criteria:
#
#	-	all contributing repositories use the same default branch.
#
#	- each repository has a docs/antora.yml file
#
#	- the antora.yml in each repository has its version: key set to the value of a tilde ( ~ )
#
#	-	the antora.playbook.yml file has its content/branches key set to [main] or
#		whatever the default branch for the repositories is.
#
#	Input(s):
#
#		The relative or absolute file path of the Antora Playbook file.
#
#	Returns:
#		0																	# The entire process succeeded.
#
#		1																	#	Some step in the process failed.
#
#	Echos:
#		STDERR:	Notification that the playbook file path has not been passed in,
#						and any error output from any step
#
#		STDOUT:	NONE
#
#	Testing status:
#		UNTESTED
